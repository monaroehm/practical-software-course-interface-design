# Practical software course interface design: Formel 1x1

This project was part of the module "Softwarepraktikum Schnittstellenentwurf", which literally translates to "practical software course interface design", in 2020/2021, my third semester at the Julius-Maximilians-Universität of Würzburg. It was created in collaboration with four other students. Unfortunately, I do not currently have a hosted database, so it won't actually run in its current state, but the video presentation of the final submission can be viewed [here](docs/formel1x1.mp4).

# The project

We used the play framework, a web application framework, to create a serious game centered around math problems and racing called Formel 1x1, *Formel* being the german word for *equation*. We used JDBC to connect to a MySQL database storing login data, scores, etc.

# Authoring tool

An authoring tool was created using JavaFX to provide a graphical user interface to manipulate the data of the database. This tool can also be seen in the video presentation ([docs/formel1x1.mp4](docs/formel1x1.mp4)), and I have also published the code here: [practical-software-course-interface-design-authoring-tool](https://github.com/monaroehm/practical-software-course-interface-design-authoring-tool)

# My contributions

I did a bit of everything (Scala, CSS, JavaScript, SQL, Java, FXML) but my focus was the logic of the game mechanics which was mostly JavaScript.
